Welcome to altui, an alternative text-based UI for UDB
======================================================

Altui provides a modern and user-friendly alternative to plain UDB and to TUI mode.

_**Warning: This is an experiment. It's buggy and has limited functionalities.**_


How to use
----------

* The panel underneath this one is a normal UDB terminal where you can type UDB commands.

* Once you start debugging, this panel will show the source code for the debugged program.

* On the right there are a few panels with useful information: the backtrace, variables, bookmarks,
  etc. You can select these using your mouse. Keyboard-based navigation is not implemented yet.

* Resizing the terminal window is not supported yet!

* Type `altui disable` to go back to normal UDB.


Bugs
----

This is a prototype so it's buggy and lots of things are not implemented yet. For comments, bugs and
questions email [Marco Barisione &lt;mbarisione@undo.io&gt;](mailto:mbarisione@undo.io).
